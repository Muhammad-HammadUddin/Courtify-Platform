# User Registration Guide

## Getting Started on Courtify

Courtify welcomes new players to join our growing community of sports enthusiasts. Registration is simple, quick, and free. This guide walks you through creating your player account so you can start booking courts immediately.

## Registration Requirements

Before you register, have the following information ready:

- **Valid Email Address**: You'll use this to log in and receive booking confirmations
- **Username**: Choose a unique username that identifies you on the platform (no spaces, minimum 3 characters recommended)
- **Secure Password**: Create a strong password at least 6 characters long
- **Phone Number** (Optional but recommended): Useful for receiving notifications and urgent updates
- **Basic Info**: Gender information (optional) helps courts and matchmakers connect better

## Step-by-Step Registration

### Step 1: Access Registration
Open Courtify and look for the "Register" or "Sign Up" button on the login page. New users should click this to begin.

### Step 2: Choose Your Role
Select "Player" as your account type. (Note: Court owners have a separate registration process with additional requirements.)

### Step 3: Enter Email
Provide your valid email address. This must be unique - you cannot use an email already registered on Courtify. Double-check spelling to ensure you receive important notifications.

### Step 4: Create Username
Choose a unique username that will appear to other users in the community. This should be memorable and professional, as it will be visible in your booking history and reviews.

### Step 5: Set Password
Create a strong password combining letters, numbers, and special characters. Remember this password securely, as you'll need it to log in. Courtify cannot retrieve forgotten passwords without email verification.

### Step 6: Add Optional Information
- Enter your phone number to receive SMS or push notifications
- Specify your gender (helps with matchmaking and community features)

### Step 7: Review and Confirm
Review all entered information for accuracy. Once confirmed, your account will be created and you can immediately start using Courtify.

## Email Verification

After registration, you may receive a verification email to confirm your email address. Check your inbox (and spam folder if needed) and click the verification link. This ensures:
- Your email address is valid
- You have access to receive important platform notifications
- Password recovery is possible

## Creating a Secure Account

For maximum account security:

- **Use a Strong Password**: Avoid common words or sequences. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- **Protect Your Email**: Don't share your login email with others. Each account is personal to one user
- **Unique Credentials**: Don't reuse passwords from other platforms
- **Secure Device**: Register from a device you trust and keep private
- **Change Password Regularly**: Update your password every few months

## First Steps After Registration

Once your account is created:

1. **Complete Your Profile**: Add a profile picture and bio if desired (optional but recommended for better community integration)
2. **Review Safety Tips**: Familiarize yourself with booking best practices
3. **Set Preferences**: Configure notification preferences for bookings and messages
4. **Search Courts**: Browse available courts in your area
5. **Make Your First Booking**: Reserve a court to experience the platform

## Account Rules for Players

All registered players agree to:

- **One Account Per Person**: Each player should have only one active account
- **Accurate Information**: Provide truthful information during registration
- **Respect Platform Rules**: Follow all Courtify guidelines and policies
- **Professional Conduct**: Treat other users with respect
- **Honor Bookings**: Take booked slots seriously and cancel responsibly

## If You Already Have an Account

If you've previously registered on Courtify:
- Use the "Login" button instead of "Register"
- Enter your email and password
- If you forgot your password, use the "Forgot Password" link to reset it
- Verify your identity through email verification

## Troubleshooting Registration Issues

### Email Already Registered
This means the email address is already associated with a Courtify account. Either:
- Use a different email address for your new account
- Use "Forgot Password" if you already had an account

### Username Taken
Try a variation:
- Add numbers or underscore
- Use a different creative username
- Keep it simple and memorable

### Password Not Accepted
Ensure your password:
- Is at least 6 characters long
- Doesn't match your username
- Includes a mix of character types

### Verification Email Not Received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Wait a few minutes for email delivery
- Verify you entered your email correctly during registration
- Request a new verification email through the app

## Next Steps

- Search for courts by location and type
- View court details, pricing, and reviews
- Add courts to favorites for quick access
