## How to Search for Courts

### Basic Search

When you open Courtify, you'll see the court listing page showing all approved courts available on the platform. You can browse through all options or refine your search.

### Search Filters

To narrow down courts to your preferences:

- **Location**: Filter by area or venue name to find courts near you
- **Sport Type**: Select the sport you want to play (badminton, squash, tennis, etc.)
- **Pricing**: View hourly rates to find courts within your budget
- **Availability**: See which courts have slots available on your preferred date

### Viewing Court Details

Click on any court to see comprehensive information:

- **Court Name and Location**: Exact venue address and directions
- **Hourly Rate**: Cost per hour to book the court
- **Operating Hours**: What time the court opens and closes
- **Court Type**: Specific sport facilities available

## Understanding Court Information

### Hourly Rate
The hourly rate is the cost per hour to book the court. If a court costs 2000 PKR per hour and you book it for 2 hours, the total cost is 4000 PKR. You'll typically pay a deposit online and settle any remaining balance in person.

### Operating Hours
Courts have specific opening and closing times. For example, a court may be open from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. You can only book slots within these hours.

### Maintenance Status
If a court shows as "Under Maintenance," it's temporarily unavailable for bookings. Check back later when maintenance is complete.

## The Booking Process

### Step 1: Select Your Court
Browse courts and choose one that matches your needs. Read reviews to ensure quality.

### Step 2: Choose Date and Time
Click on "Book Now" or a specific time slot. Select:
- **Booking Date**: The day you want to play (cannot be in the past)
- **Start Time**: When you want to begin playing
- **End Time**: When you'll finish playing

The system shows all available slots. Grayed-out times are already booked by other players.

### Step 3: Review Booking Details
Before confirming, verify:
- Court name is correct
- Date and time match your preferences
- Duration (hours) is correct
- Total amount is what you expected

### Step 4: Confirm Booking
Click "Confirm Booking" to proceed. The court owner will receive a notification of your booking request.

### Step 5: Payment
Courtify requires an advance payment (deposit) to confirm your booking. You'll be directed to a secure payment page where you can enter your card details. The remaining balance (if any) will be collected when you arrive at the court.

### Step 6: Booking Confirmation

### After Payment is Complete

If you need to modify or cancel:
- Contact the court owner as soon as possible
- Explain your situation clearly
