# Tracking Your Bookings

## Managing Your Bookings

Courtify provides a comprehensive dashboard where you can track all your current and past bookings. This guide explains how to monitor your reservations, understand booking statuses, and manage your scheduling.

## Accessing Your Bookings

### Dashboard Overview
Log in to Courtify and navigate to your personal dashboard. Here you'll find a "My Bookings" or "Bookings" section that displays:
- Upcoming bookings (next 30 days)
- Recent past bookings (completed)
- Booking status for each reservation
- Key details like court name, date, time, and cost

### Filtering and Sorting
You can organize your bookings by:
- **Date**: See bookings in chronological order

- **Status**: Filter by pending, confirmed, cancelled, or completed
- **Month**: View bookings within specific time periods

## Understanding Booking Statuses

Your booking progresses through several statuses, each indicating a different stage:

### Pending
Your booking request has been created and sent to the court owner. The court owner is reviewing it. During this phase:
- You have not yet been charged the full amount
- The court owner may approve or reject your request
- You should wait for their response before making payment
- This typically takes a few hours to one business day

**What to do**: Check your email and dashboard regularly for the owner's response.

### Approved
The court owner has accepted your booking request. Now you need to complete payment:
- You'll see a "Pay Now" button on the booking details
- An advance deposit is required to confirm
- After payment, your booking becomes "Confirmed"
- Make sure to complete payment before your play time

**What to do**: Complete the payment as soon as possible to secure your spot.

### Confirmed
Payment has been received and your booking is fully secured:
- Your court slot is reserved
- You have a guaranteed booking
- You can proceed with your plans
- The balance (if any) is due when you arrive

**What to do**: Prepare for your game and arrive on time.

### Completed
Your booking time has passed and the session is finished:
- The booking is archived in your history
- You can leave a review and rating
- This booking is no longer active
- Information is kept for records and reviews

**What to do**: Leave feedback to help other players, or use it for repeat bookings.

### Rejected
The court owner has declined your booking request:
- The court slot remains available for other players
- You won't be charged any amount
- Review the reason if provided
- You can search for alternative courts or times

**What to do**: Find another available court or contact the owner for clarification.

### Cancelled
Either you or the court owner has cancelled this booking:
- If you initiated cancellation, a refund policy applies
