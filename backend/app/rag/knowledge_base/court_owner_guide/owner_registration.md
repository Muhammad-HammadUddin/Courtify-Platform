## Step-by-Step Owner Registration

### Step 6: Access Owner Dashboard
Once approved, you can immediately:

## Important: Courts Require Separate Approval

After creating your account, each individual court you list must be submitted for approval:

1. Fill out detailed court information
2. Add photos of your facilities
3. Set pricing and operating hours
4. Submit for admin review
5. Await approval (typically 24-48 hours)
