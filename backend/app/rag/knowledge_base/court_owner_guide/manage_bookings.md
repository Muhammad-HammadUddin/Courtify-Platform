# Managing Player Bookings

## Court Owner Booking Management

As a court owner, managing player bookings is central to your business. Courtify provides tools to efficiently handle booking requests, communicate with players, track reservations, and maintain smooth operations. This guide covers all aspects of booking management from your owner perspective.

## Accessing Booking Management

In your owner dashboard, go to the "Bookings" or "Reservations" section. Here you'll see:
- All incoming booking requests (pending approval)
- Approved bookings with confirmed dates/times
- Completed bookings (history)
- Cancelled bookings with reasons
- Calendar view of all reservations

## Understanding Booking Workflow

When a player books your court, the booking goes through several stages:

### Stage 1: Booking Request (Pending)
- Player submits booking request
- You receive notification
- Court slot is temporarily held
- Player hasn't paid yet
- You must approve or reject

### Stage 2: Approval Decision
- You review the request
- Click "Approve" to accept
- Click "Reject" if you can't accommodate
- Player notified of your decision
- Notification arrives via email/app

### Stage 3: Payment Processing
After approval:
- Player receives payment request
- Player pays advance deposit
- Courtify confirms payment
- Booking becomes "Confirmed"
- You're notified of confirmation

### Stage 4: Booking Confirmed
- Player has paid advance
- Booking is secured
- Slot is no longer available to others
- Player will arrive at scheduled time
- Player owes any remaining balance in person

### Stage 5: Completion
- After booking time passes
- Booking marked as "Completed"
- Booking moved to history
- Player can leave review and rating
- Transaction is archived

## Managing Pending Bookings

Pending bookings need your immediate attention - players are waiting for your response.

### Viewing Pending Requests
In your dashboard, filter to show only "Pending" bookings. Each shows:
- Player name and profile
- Requested date and time
- Duration (hours)
- Expected court fee
- Booking time (how long they've been waiting)
- Special requests or notes (if any)

### Reviewing a Booking Request
Click on a pending booking to see:
- Complete player profile (name, rating history)
- Detailed booking information
- Your court's availability at that time
- Any conflicts with other bookings
- Player's contact information
- Previous bookings history with you

### Approving Bookings
