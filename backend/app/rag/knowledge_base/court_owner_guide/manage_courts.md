# Managing Your Courts

## Court Management Overview

Once your court is listed and approved on Courtify, managing it effectively is key to maximizing bookings and maintaining your reputation. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of court management including pricing, availability, information updates, and performance tracking.

## Accessing Your Court Management Dashboard

- View all your listed courts

## Updating Court Information

## Managing Pricing

### Setting Hourly Rates
Your pricing strategy affects bookings:

## Managing Availability and Hours

### Setting Operating Hours
Define when your court is available for booking:
- **Opening Time**: When bookings can start (e.g., 6:00 AM)
- **Closing Time**: When bookings must end (e.g., 10:00 PM)
- Apply consistently daily unless you mark specific days off
- Consider staff availability
- Plan maintenance windows

### Scheduling Maintenance
When your court needs service:

1. Go to court settings
2. Select "Schedule Maintenance"
3. Choose maintenance dates and times
4. Specify duration (hours or days)
5. Add maintenance notes (optional)
6. Confirm - court marked as unavailable for those periods

**Effects of Maintenance**:
- Players cannot book during maintenance windows
- Existing bookings in maintenance periods are automatically affected

- Court returns to available status automatically after maintenance ends

### Managing Specific Closures
For temporary closures beyond maintenance:
- Holiday closures
- Emergency shutdowns
- Special events
- Weather-related closures
- Owner-initiated breaks

Mark these clearly so players aren't confused.

## Updating Court Photos

### Removing Outdated Photos
After facility renovations or improvements:

This helps players find exactly what they're looking for.
